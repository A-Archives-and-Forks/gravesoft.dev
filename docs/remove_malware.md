## What's next?

:::tip[Important]

- Antimalware can remove most of the malware but can not undo all the damage done by the malware in the system.  
  For example, malware can infect system files, damage Windows updates and security and important registries, or even hide the malware somewhere antimalware can not find. 

- Due to this reason, in the event of a malware infection, **you must perform a clean installation of the system** using a bootable USB drive and formatting the C drive. (Do not use the reset option, malware can persist in that case.)
