# Bypass Microsoft Geoblocking

Microsoft blocks services in certain countries due to U.S. laws and local legal regulations. For example, users in Russia may not be able to download Windows or Office.

Countries with broad restrictions:  
`Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela`

Countries with limited Microsoft Store app functionality:  
`CU, IR, KP, SS, SD, SY`  
`MR, VE, EH, AS, BQ, FK, TF, GG, IM, JE, LB, CW, ME, YT, BL, SH, MF, PM, ST, SX, UM, AX`

`We are unable to complete your request at this time. Some users, entities and locations are banned from using this service.

#### How is Microsoft blocking it?

Primarily, it checks for Russian IP addresses, and based on that, the above error is shown to users. However that's not the end of it. Once it find out that Russian IP is used, the installer creates the registry key below to remember it. After that, even if you use a VPN, the installer will still keep showing the error.

```         
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\ExperimentConfigs\Ecs]
"CountryCode"="std::wstring|RU"
```

### Solution 1

-   Open command prompt as admin and enter,

```         
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\ExperimentConfigs\Ecs" /v "CountryCode" /t REG_SZ /d "std::wstring|US" /f
```

After that, the office installer won't show any related errors. You can apply this before or after running the Office installer and you can download Office without any VPN with your Russian IP address.

**Or**

### Solution 2

-   Use the [Offline installer file](office_c2r_links.md) to install Office.

## Microsoft Store App

If the Microsoft Store app isn’t working in your region, you can try changing your region in Windows settings to access it.
